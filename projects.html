                <h2>Website Development</h2>
                <p>Recently, I found myself working with a firm to assemble a webpage that displays data from their API. This project really helped me improve my React skill. I had also added functionality to display the data using the Google Maps API. I had come across an issue where the UI I had made was not very intuitive and lacked quality in design. In my next project I hope to eradicate this issue by bettering my React skill as well as learning SASS. I have also made a website version of my CVlink to GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/djtaraz/websiteCV.git">https://github.com/djtaraz/websiteCV.git</a>.

                <p>I was part of a voluntary robotics group in London where we built a machine that can play the game “four in a row.” I was involved with the development of the algorithm that sets the rules of the game with interchangeable difficulty levels.</p>

                <h2>App development bootcamp</h2>
                <p>In 2018, I attended a bootcamp where I was taught iOS application development with Swift. We created an app that allowed musicians to connect with people who have similar interests and allowed them to collaborate on various music projects,
                    with a function akin to Tinder.</p>

                <h2>Music production</h2>
                <p>– I have enjoyed making music since I was a child with the help of a platform called FL studio. This has helped me to learn how to structure any project made on an IDE, helping me to make my code understandable to other programmers.</p>
